# Image Recognition (Realtime)
The project is focused on delivering rough image recognition using rgb values and color manipulation. The current state of the program is to recognize an 'accept' button in games and accept the match for you. This functionality is only a test and a start of a much more dynamic approach to a game overlay that can automate many tasks, efficiently and quickly.

# Code
Most of the graphics api used to capture images is multiple-source code.
Very much still a work in progress.

# Compilation
Program compiles using Visual Studio 2022 Community with C++ 17 support.
